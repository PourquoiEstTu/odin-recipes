    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This amount of ingredients will give you 12 cookies.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-natural creamy/drippy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut palm sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate whey protein powder*</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup mini choco chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <aside>* Whey protein as we prefer the texture of it over plant-base cookies. 
            Also, the sweetness of the protein powder will affect the taste, so 
            take care not to make the cookies not sweet enough or too sweet!

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, preheat the oven to 350ºF and spray a baking sheet with 
            coconut oil cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Place all ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and mix to combine. 
            The consistency should be similar to cookie dough. It should 
            NOT be crumbly and if it is, this is a sign your peanut 
            butter is not drippy enough and we recommend adding 1-2 
            teaspoons of melted coconut oil.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon out 2 tablespoons of dough into your palms and roll into a 
            ball. Flatten cookie dough between your palms creating a cookie 
            shape and place it on a baking sheet. Note that your cookies 
            won't expand a lot, so flattening is important.
        </li>
        <li>If desired, place mini chocolate chips on top of each cookie.</li>
        <li>Bake chocolate peanut butter protein cookies at 350ºF for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool for 15 minutes before removing from the pan so that the 
            protein cookies can set. If you remove them too soon, they may 
            break in half.
        </li>
    </ol>
